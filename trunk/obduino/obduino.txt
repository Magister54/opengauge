Role of the three buttons:

        realtime display      menu display
LEFT    rotate screen         decrease, select NO
MIDDLE  go into menu          apply and go to next item
RIGHT   rotate brightness     increase, select YES
MIDDLE+LEFT tank reset
MIDDLE+RIGHT trip reset

When you press middle and left button, a screen appear:
- Reset tank data (NO/YES)
  Select if you want to reset the data and press middle button to ack.

When you press middle and right button, a screen appear:
- Reset trip data (NO/YES)
  Select if you want to reset the data and press middle button to ack.

Configuration menu (accessed by middle button);

- LCD Contrast (0-100)
  Set the LCD contrast from 0 to 100 in step 10
  
- Use Metric units (NO/YES)
  NO=rods and hogshead, YES=SI
  
- Fuel/hour speed (0-255)
  Speed from which the display go from L/100 or MPG to L/h or GPH

- Tank size (n.m)
  Size of your tank in litres or gallon

- Volume Efficiency (0-100%) (MAP only)
  For vehicles with a MAP only we have to emulate the MAF.
  This percentage will needs adjustment after you have checked manually
  a few tank to better approximate the fuel consumption.

- Engine Displacement (0.0-10.0) (MAP only)
  For vehicles with a MAP only we have to emulate the MAF.
  This is the size of the engine, e.g. 2.0 for a 2Liters one.

- Configure PIDs (NO/YES)
  Choose if you want to configure the PIDs in the various screen.

- Scr 'n' Corner 'm' (0x00-0xFF)
  (if you have selected YES at the previous item)
  Select the PID you want to be displayed on screen 'n' in the corner 'm'.
  Some specials PIDs you can access (either by decreasing below 0 or by
  going far up):
  0xF0 - no display, meaning this corner will be blank, can be useful if
         another PID result is more than 8 characters
  0xF1 - Instant fuel consumption
  0xF2 - Average fuel consumption of the tank (since last tank reset)
  0xF3 - Fuel used in the current tank
  0xF4 - Distance done on the current tank
  0xF5 - Remaining distance that can be done on the current tank
  0xF6 - Average fuel consumption of the trip (since last trip reset)
  0xF7 - Fuel used for the current trip
  0xF8 - Distance of the current trip
  0xF9 - Battery voltage (of the car)
  0xFA - CAN status, for CAN only protocol only, display TX and RX errors
