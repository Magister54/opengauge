Here's the proposed diagram of the [http://arduino.cc Arduino] board, the LCD screen, and the [OBDuinoInterface ISO interface].

= Hardware =

You need (for ISO):
  # a duino clone board, serial or USB, your choice
  # an HD44780 compatible LCD screen 2x16
  # a transistor 2N3906 or NTE159
  # three small push buttons
  # a 220 ohms resistor
  # a Freescale MC33290 ic
  # a 510 ohms resistor
  # a DB9 male

==Some pictures of the hardware==

A clone board called the freeduino, some headers were missing when I took pictures:

The LCD screen with its wires attached, note the transistor and the resistor, covered by (not yet heated) shrink tube, on the right side:

Freeduino and LCD attached, it's just missing the 3 buttons and the [OBDuinoInterface ISO interface].
