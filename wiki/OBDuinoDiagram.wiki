Here's the proposed diagram of the Arduino board, the LCD screen, and the [OBDuinoInterface interface].

Some pictures of the hardware

An arduino clone board called the freeduino, some headers were missing when I took the pictures:

The LCD screen with its wires attached, note the transistor and the resistor, covered by (not yet heated) shrink tube, on the right side:

Freeduino and LCD attached, it's just missing the 3 buttons and the [OBDuinoInterface ISO interface].
