#summary OBDuino Interface adapter

= Introduction =

You cannot plug directly the signals from the OBD-II to the Arduino board.
You need a small interface that adapt the signal.


= Details =

==Cable==

To keep compatibility with already existing cable, the OBD-II to DB9F cable is wired like this:

{{{
DB9F			OBD-II
1---------------5 (Signal ground)
2---------------4 (Chassis ground)
3-NC
4---------------7 (ISO K line)
5-NC
6---------------10 (J1850 bus-, future use)
7---------------2  (J1850 bus+, future use)
8-NC
9---------------16 (Battery)
}}}
*Do not plug it into a PC!!! This goes to an interface only!!!*

You can make it yourself with an OBD-II plug available at http://www.carplugs.com/ for $5+$3sh. Use at least AWG24 wires especially for Battery and Chassis ground

Or buy an already made cable at http://www.obd2allinone.com/ for $10+$5sh


==Interface==

The cable goes into an interface to adapt the ISO signal for the Arduino input.
It concists of a small IC, a resistor, a DB9M that will be plugged with the
cable mentionned above, and a few wires that connect to the Arduino board.
Schematic is like this:
{{{

                            |       |                  \ goes a 510 ohms resistor

Arduino 5V pin output -----8|CEN VBB|1-----------------+------- DB9M pin 9 (12V Battery)
                            +-------+
}}}                  
The Arduino is powered by the 12V line coming from the cable too

Arduino GND input ------------------ DB9M pin 4 (Chassis Ground)
