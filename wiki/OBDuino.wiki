#summary OBDuino Description

= Introduction =

The OBDuino is an in-car real-time display of various information, like speed, RPM, instant fuel consumption or average trip fuel consumption as well as others PIDs supported by the car.

= Details =

The name OBDuino comes from OBD which means [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Board_Diagnostics On Board Diagnostics], and from the development board which is an [http://arduino.cc Arduino] (or a clone).
It is based on an Atmel AVR ATMEGA168P chip that contains 16K of flash, 1K of RAM and 512bytes of EEPROM, an LCD display, 3 buttons, a few $ of electronics components.

The interface to the car is made (for the moment) with an ELM327 (a PIC) that talk PWM/VPW/ISO/CAN. Note that PWM/VPW/ISO should be possible to use without an ELM chip easily as the protocol can be find on the net and is not very complicated, but it would require a few resistors, capacitors and transistors, as well as some mods to the code.

The OBDuino connect to the car on it's OBD-II plug which is in general under the dash. A lot of signals are on this plug as well as battery voltage and ground. Using a standard OBD-II to DB9F cable brings us what we need.

It can display 4 information at a time, plus there is virtual screens to have access to others PIDs. By default there is 3 screens available so it makes 12 PIDs available quickly.

= Main Hardware =

The Arduino or a clone can be purchased assembled, in a kit, or you can even etch it yourself. Take the flavour you want for serial or USB depending on your PC/laptop configuration. All the clone should work the same, except the very small one that use 3.3V and 8MHz and even there, it should work too.

To play with, you can start with a "big" board like an Arduino Diecimila or a Freeduino SB, and to integrate in the car you can use a Boarduino or an iDuino by after.

The LCD screen used is a 2 rows x 16 characters using a standard HD44780 or compatible chipset, they can be found on eBay for $4, and they exist in almost every colours as well as STN, FSTN and even OLED (although more expensive).

The 3 buttons are momentary push button switches, take the one you want.

You need also a 220 omhs resistor and a PNP 2N3906 or equivalement like an NTE159 to drive the LCD brightness, as it can take up to 200mA on some LCD and the pin used to drive brightness is limited to about 20mA.

= Interfacing =

The code was made around a simple ISO interface or with the use of the ELM327 especially for CAN (all 2008+ vehicles sold in North America shall use CAN). You will need to make the interface specific for your car, see [OBDuinoInterface Interface].

I (Frédéric) am currently working on a CAN only interface using Microchip MCP2515 and MCP2551. I found a nice CAN library and adapted the code to use it. It can drive the cost of the whole OBDuino "CAN only" to about $40. More info soon.

= Menu Configuration ==

== Role of the three buttons ==

||        || realtime display  || menu display ||
|| LEFT   ||  rotate screen    || decrease, select NO ||
|| MIDDLE || go into menu      || apply and go to next item ||
|| RIGHT  || rotate brightness || increase, select YES ||
|| MIDDLE+RIGHT || trip reset ||  ||
|| MIDDLE+LEFT || tank trip reset ||  ||


=== Reset trip data (NO/YES) ===
When you press middle and right button, a screen appear: Select if you want to reset the data and press middle button to ack.

=== Reset tank data (NO/YES) ===
When you press middle and left button, a screen appear: Select if you want to reset the data and press middle button to ack.

== Configuration menu (accessed by middle button) ==

=== LCD Contrast (0-100) === 
Set the LCD contrast from 0 to 100 in step 10
  
=== Use Metric units (NO/YES) === 
NO=rods and hogshead, YES=SI
  
=== Fuel/hour speed (0-255) === 
Speed from which the display go from L/100 or MPG, to L/h or GPH
  
=== Tank size (n.m) ===
Size of your tank in litres or gallon

=== Volume Efficiency (0-100%) (MAP only) === 
For vehicles with a MAP only we have to emulate the MAF.
This percentage will needs adjustment after you have checked manually a few tank to approximate better the fuel consumption.
  
=== Engine Displacement (0.0-10.0) (MAP only) === 
For vehicles with a MAP only we have to emulate the MAF.
This is the size of the engine, e.g. 2.0 for a 2Liter one.
  
=== Configure PIDs (NO/YES) === 
Choose if you want to configure the PIDs in the various screen.
  
===  Scr 'n' Corner 'm' (0x00-0xFF) === 
(if you have selected YES at the previous item)
Select the PID you want to be displayed on screen 'n' in the corner 'm'.
Some specials PIDs you can access (either by decreasing below 0 or by going far up):
  * 0xF0 - no display, meaning this corner will be blank, can be useful if another PID result is more than 8 characters
  * 0xF1 - Instant fuel consumption
  * 0xF2 - Average fuel consumption of the tank (since last tank reset)
  * 0xF3 - Fuel used in the current tank
  * 0xF4 - Distance done on the current tank
  * 0xF5 - Remaining distance that can be done on the current tank
  * 0xF6 - Average fuel consumption of the trip (since last trip reset)
  * 0xF7 - Fuel used for the current trip
  * 0xF8 - Distance of the current trip
  * 0xF9 - Battery voltage
  * 0xFA - CAN status, for CAN only protocol only, display TX and RX errors
